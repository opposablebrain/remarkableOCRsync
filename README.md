# reMarkable tablet sync and page OCR
A moderate hack for syncing notebooks off the reMarkable, converting them to PDF form, and running OCR on the pages. Attempts to only convert changed pages. Uses AWS textract for OCR. Can sync from cloud using [rmapi][5] or directly with SSH-over-USB. Switches seamlessly between the two sync mechanisms. Only syncs one-way: down.

Loosely tested with a reMarkable2 on Linux and OSX(intel).

I admit this is not entirely end-user-friendly. If you know your way around a Unix shell, you should be ok.

I wrote this in a couple of evenings and don't have the time to support it properly. If you like it, help me make it better.

# Requirements
* `[brew/apt/dnf] install imagemagick jq awscli`
* `pip install boto3 pypdf2`
* [rm2pdf][1] built and installed in your path
* [rmapi][5] built and installed in your path

# Setup
## AWS Textract Handwriting Recognition

`aws configure` 

[This may help][2] (also look at [pricing][4] for OCR)

## For Web API sync
The first time you run, the script will prompt you to get an authorization code from remarkable. That's all.

## For SSH-over-USB sync (and to get notebook UUIDs)
[Set up passwordless ssh and rsync on your tablet][3]

Example `.ssh/config` section:
    
    Host remarkable
    User root
    ControlMaster no
    ControlPath none
    Hostname 10.11.99.1


## Notebook Selection
Enter the names of the notebooks you want to sync, exactly as shown on the device, in `notebooks.conf`. Make sure you **add a newline at the end of the file** or the last notebook won't be processed. Example:
    
    Quick sheets
    My Other Notebook
    Work Notes
        ‎‎

# Usage

From the repo folder, update the notebook list per the above instructions and try running `./rmocrsync.sh ssh` or `./rmocrsync.sh web`. It _should_ work out of the box. 

If it completes successfully, take a look in the `notebooks` folder. You should have a folder of OCR text files (one file per page), and an annotated PDF that embeds the text in each page.

_Note: The files in the `meta` folder are used to track changed pages across sync sessions. You probably shouldn't mess with these._
