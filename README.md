# Remarkable tablet sync and page OCR
A quick hack for syncing notebooks off the Remarkable, converting them to PDF form, and running OCR on the pages. Attempts to only convert changed pages. Uses AWS textract for OCR.

Loosely tested on Linux and OSX(intel).

I wrote this in an evening and don't have the time to support it properly.
If you like it, help me make it better.

# Requirements
* `[brew/apt/dnf] install imagemagick jq awscli`
* `pip install boto3`
* [rm2pdf][1] built and installed in your path
[1]: https://github.com/rorycl/rm2pdf.git "rm2pdf @ github"

# Setup
* `aws configure` [this may help][2]
* [Set up ssh and rsync on your tablet][3]
    - Example `.ssh/config` section:
    ```
    Host rm
    User root
    ControlMaster no
    ControlPath none
    Hostname 10.11.99.1
    ```
* SSH to the tablet and find the hashes of the notebooks you want to sync
    -  `ssh root@10.11.99.1`
    -  `ln -s ~/.local/share/remarkable/xochitl ~/content` <- for convenience
    -  `cd content`
    -  `grep [notebook_name] *.metadata|cut -f1 -d '.'` <- start here, then look at the metadata file to confirm
* Back on the mainland, add the notebook hashes to `notebooks.conf`, one per line
* Check the config variables at top of `rmocrsync.sh`

# Usage
Try running `./rmocrsync.sh` It might work out of the box.
